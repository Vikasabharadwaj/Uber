## The Analysis

Each SQL query was designed to extract meaningful insights from Uber trip data.

### 1. Successful Rides

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Trip_Details
WHERE Ride_Status = 'Success';
```
Provides details of successfully completed trips.
Helps track business success rate.
Insight: Completed rides reflect operational efficiency and customer engagement.

### 2. Average Ride Distance per Vehicle Type

```sql
SELECT 
    Vehicle_Type, 
    ROUND(AVG(Distance_km), 2)::text || ' km' AS avg_distance
FROM Trip_Details
GROUP BY Vehicle_Type;
```
Shows which vehicles are preferred for longer or shorter trips.
Insight: Sedans and SUVs usually cover longer distances; Bikes and Autos mostly handle short city rides.

### 3. Customer Cancellations
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cancelled_by_customers
FROM Trip_Details
WHERE Ride_Status = 'Cancelled by Customer';
```
Helps understand customer behavior and dissatisfaction patterns.
Insight: High cancellations may indicate pricing issues, delays, or user experience problems.

### 4. Top 5 Customers by Ride Count

```sql
SELECT Customer_ID, COUNT(Ride_ID) AS total_rides
FROM Trip_Details
GROUP BY Customer_ID
ORDER BY total_rides DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Identifies the most loyal/high-value customers.
Insight: Top customers can be targeted with loyalty rewards or premium offers.

### 5.Driver Cancellations

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cancelled_by_driver
FROM Trip_Details
WHERE Driver_Cancellations = 'Personal & Car related issue';
```

Highlights operational inefficiencies due to driver issues.
Insight: Monitoring driver cancellations helps optimize driver management.

## Closing Thoughts

This project significantly strengthened my SQL and Power BI skills while offering a hands-on understanding of real-world data analysis. The insights gained from analyzing Uber trip data not only demonstrate technical proficiency but also highlight how data-driven decisions can optimize operations and enhance customer satisfaction.  

For aspiring data analysts, this project underscores the value of mastering both **data querying (SQL)** and **data visualization (Power BI/DAX)** to extract actionable insights. It emphasizes the importance of continuous learning, adapting to new tools, and building a strong analytical mindset to stay competitive in the ever-evolving field of data analytics.


## üèÅ Conclusion & Takeaways
This deep dive into Uber's July 2024 data reveals a stable operation with clear patterns. While ratings are consistently high and the vehicle fleet is well-balanced, the high cancellation rate‚Äîdriven primarily by driver-related issues‚Äîpresents a major opportunity for improvement. Revenue is heavily reliant on cash payments and a core group of loyal customers. Focusing on reducing cancellations and encouraging digital payments could further boost efficiency and profitability.

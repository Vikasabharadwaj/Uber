## Background

This project was designed to analyze Uber trip data to understand:

- How different **vehicle types perform** in terms of distance and revenue  
- **Customer satisfaction** through ratings  
- **Ride cancellations** from customers and drivers  
- **Payment method adoption**, e.g., UPI usage  
- **Operational performance** to identify inefficiencies  

The insights also serve as the foundation for **Power BI dashboards**, where trends, patterns, and KPIs can be visualized dynamically.

### Questions answered through SQL and Power BI

1. How many rides were successfully completed?  
2. What is the **average distance per vehicle type**?  
3. How many rides were cancelled by customers or drivers?  
4. Who are the top customers by ride count?  
5. What are the **max/min driver ratings** per vehicle type?  
6. How do customers rate different vehicle types?  
7. What is the **total revenue** from completed rides?  
8. Which rides used **UPI payments**?  
9. What are the reasons for **incomplete rides**?

## The Analysis

Each SQL query was designed to extract meaningful insights from Uber trip data.

### 1. Successful Rides

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Trip_Details
WHERE Ride_Status = 'Success';
